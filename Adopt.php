                    At the Pawadise shelters in Bacolod and Bulacan, hundreds of rescues are waiting to find their fur-ever homes. 
                    Many of our Adoptables have been rescued from death row, from local pounds or from abusive environments. 
                    They are all <b>vaccinated</b>, <b>dewormed</b> <b>and neutered</b> and can be visited anytime, just with prior registration.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="parag"> 
                    By choosing to adopt, you are giving an animal the chance to find a new home and to feel the love and security they deserve. 
                    You are also helping free up more space in our shelters, allowing us to rescue and rehabilate more animals.
                </p>
                <p class="parag">
                    Please note that starting Jan 2022, we will be implementing a <b>PHP1,000 ADOPTION FEE</b> to help with the upkeep of the shelter and also to cover what we have spent for the rescues’ rehabilitation. 
                    We also want to make sure that our adopters have the capacity to meet the needs of our rescues, who we all treat as family.
                </p>
                <p class="parag">
                    We are also advocates of adopting from <b>local pounds</b>, where dogs are regularly scheduled to be euthanized using inhumane methods due to lack of funding. 
                    If you are interested and need guidance from the Pawssion Project team, feel free to contact us as well.
